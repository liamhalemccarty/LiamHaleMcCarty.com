In September 2020, my brother Aidan and I launched [Trump Donald](https://www.TrumpDonald.us), a site that let people donate small amounts of money to support Biden every time Trump tweeted. As we said: _When Donald gives us his "two cents", you give his opponent 2¢ (or more). Let's make Trump (literally) pay for his tweets!_

We also we built a Twitter bot ([@TrumpTheDonald_](https://twitter.com/TrumpTheDonald_)) that replied to Trump every time he tweeted, telling him how much money that tweet sent to his opponent. And even better, we let people connect their Twitter accounts so that, every time Trump tweeted, _their_ account replied, telling him how much they just donated to support Biden.

We are very proud to say that Trump Donald raised more money to support Joe Biden in 2020 than Donald Trump paid in taxes in 2016.
