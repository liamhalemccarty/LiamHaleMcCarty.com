Like many people, I was stunned to see how prevalent misinformation had become in America, especially during and after the 2016 presidential election. As the 2020 election neared, the problem only seemed to get worse, and no one seemed to know what to do about it. I felt like I barely even understood how misinformation spread, let alone how to stop it, so I embarked on a huge research project.

The result was 31 Truths of Fake News, which I turned into a video series. The videos follow a "show don't tell" approach, illustrating the principle before describing it. The result is a series of very short vidoes (each typically a few minutes long) that explain and entertain.

## How to Fight Fake News

I released one video a day for 31 days leading up to the 2020 presidential election. On the final day before the election, when truth would soon be on the ballot I released "How to Fight Fake News", the culmination of the project:
