_Data and Power: Big Data and Corporate Control in Modern America_ is a book I published my freshman year at Stanford. The summer before I arrived on campus, I began researching technology and society, curious to understand the odd world of Silicon Valley. That research spawned what I thought would be a short essay but what then became a full-length book. It's available for purchase [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Power-Corporate-Control-America/dp/0692391142).

<!-- truncate -->

_Data and Power_ examines big data and corporate control in modern America. It begins with a startling investigation of the ubiquity of big data in modern society. It then examines economic inequality in America, several Supreme Court decisions and legislative changes affecting campaign finance, and the social power of the top technology and digital media corporations. It concludes with a call to action against unwarranted concentration of power. Fundamentally, _Data and Power_ is a passionate and heavily-researched argument for raising awareness so that we, the American public, can manage the inevitable challenges big data will pose.

The cover of _Data and Power_ is a painting I created specifically for the book called _BIG DATA IS WATCHING YOU_ (see above). You may notice references to _The Great Gatsby_, _1984_, and other classic works. Read the book for a detailed description of the symbolism!

## Crowdfunding

One of my favorite parts of the _Data and Power_ project is that my community funded it â€” and I am forever grateful for that. I [crowdfunded](https://igg.me/at/data-and-power/x/8573246#/) the money I needed to publish the book and do some basic marketing. 

As a fun piece of histoy, below is my Indiegogo crowdfunding video, recorded when I was home for Christmas break my freshman year in college. It's quite cringy for me to watch now! I was trying so hard to impress the people I'd later ask for support and donations from. But it's an interesting look at how I was telling the story at the time.
