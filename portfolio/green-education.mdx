As my entry for the Siemens We Can Change the World Challenge (a national youth science competition), I lead a team of four students to educate 275 local fourth-graders about renewable energy.

<!-- truncate -->

The first part of Green Education was a presentation about wind, hydroelectric, and solar power. To make this fun and entertaining, we added demonstrations using a small windmill, a simple water turbine, and a solar panel wired to a fan. But we went a step further to leave a lasting impression on each school we visited.

I designed kinetic sculptures that my teamed helped me build. Each sculpture consisted of a large wooden frame, painted white and strung with many small spinners. Each one of the frames contained enough spinners for every fourth-grader. At the end of the show, we had all of the kids customize their spinners with school colors. The kinetic sculptures move in the wind and are meant to serve as a constant reminder of the importance of renewable energy.
