The Discovery Education 3M [Young Scientist Challenge](https://www.youngscientistlab.com/challenge) is a national youth science competition. For me, it was one of the best experiences of my life. I entered by making a video about wind power and ended up going to New York City, meeting nine other kids like me, and having the time of my life learning about science doing experiments with the others.

For the final round of the competition, I created a wound closure device designed to help deep cuts heal more quickly. Here I am demonstrating the device on a sponge model of a wound wrapped around a water bottle "arm":

Somehow, I ended up winning! I was named "America's Top Young Scientist" â€” an absurd exaggeration but one that sounds pretty cool. :slightly_smiling_face:
