# :wave: Hello!

My name's Liam. This website is a portfolio of sorts — a collection of projects I've worked on over the years. It's an eclectic mix! Use the menu and sidebars to navigate and explore.


## Background

I grew up in a small suburb in Wisconsin, moved to California for college at Stanford, and now live in Washington, DC.

I majored in physics at Stanford. Although I'm not actively working on it anymore, physics was one of my earliest passions, and I do my best to keep up with new developments in the field. 

Also in college, my brother Aidan and I started the company that we're still running today.


## Work

I spend most of my time running [Verified Inc.](/verified-inc) with my brother Aidan. We founded the company as college students in 2016 and built tools called [Be Heard](/be-heard) to let people contact their government representatives as verified constituents. Our mission was to help #SecureOurDemocracy against bots and foreign actors. 

During that effort, we built a digital identity platform and then later spun it out as a separate system and called it Verified Inc. Now, we're bringing that verified identity technology to many other sectors, aiming to build a new layer of security and trust for the internet. These are exciting times!

## Projects

Outside of work, I pursue _many_ different [projects](/). Explore this site to see some of them, and please let me know what you think and how I can improve the site.

Thanks for checking out my little corner of the web. Enjoy!
